Hello Everyone

My name is Carlos, I'm a naturally curious person which has allowed me to develop a tendency to question everything also I have always liked analyzing patterns and the behaviours of my surroundings.

I studied Industrial Engineering at the Regiomontana University (U-ERRE) in Nuevo Leon, Mexico and made a research study on Data Engineering at the Ritsumeikan University in Japan.
