I am passionate about modelling to solve real-life problems using econometrics, machine learning, and statistical theory. I have experience mainly in the banking, pension, investment and insurance sectors with efficient staff management. I have applied econometric models and machine learning algorithms in financial risk management, evaluation of investment projects, actuarial analysis, prevention of money laundering, financing of terrorism, and fraud. To do my analysis I use R, SAS, Python, KNIME, Apache Spark, Power BI, Stata, Matlab and Azure (Data Bricks). I do research along with the Complutense University of Madrid.
