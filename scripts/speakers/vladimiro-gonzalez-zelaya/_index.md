Full-time lecturer at Universidad Panamericana's Faculty of Economics and Business Sciences, where I teach Maths and Data Science courses at both undergrad and postgrad levels. I did my PhD in Computer Science at Newcastle University, UK, with a thesis on preprocessing methods for algorithmic fairness. I also have an MRes in Cloud Computing from Newcastle University, with a dissertation on algorithmic transparency. I have another MSc in Mathematics from UNAM, Mexico, with a thesis on combinatorial games. I have worked as a data consultant at Akzo-Nobel in the UK. I'm also a video-game developer (my game Baby Bee may be found on Steam) and an avid 5-dan go player, winning the 2011 Latin-America Go Championship, and the Mexican Go Championship on several occasions. My other passion is photography, focusing on macro, wildlife and landscape scenes.
