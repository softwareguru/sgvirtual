<p>Can you deploy to production many times per day? Is the time from code change to deployment less than an hour? When something breaks, do you even know about it?</p>

<p>With new development, it can be straightforward to automate the entire delivery pipeline. But most of us are not working with new codebases, but existing applications and systems as well. And very often, the build and release process is not a push of a button, but a very long Word document.</p>

<p>It can feel overwhelming to try to improve these situations, but it can be done. In this talk, we will look at the tools and techniques to take an existing legacy application with no automation and no operational insight, and bring it fully into a complete DevOps solution.</p>
