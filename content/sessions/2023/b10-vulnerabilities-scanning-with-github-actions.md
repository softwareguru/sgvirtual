In this workshop, you are going to learn how to implement security and vulnerability scanning in your code by using already available Github Actions on your Github Actions Workflows. We will cover vulnerability scanning for application code (a Python Lambda function) and for the Infrastructure as Code (Cloudformation, docker). We will learn how to use tools like: Checkov, gitleaks, Grype, and Trivy
