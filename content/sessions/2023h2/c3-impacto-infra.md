Select the right infrastructure is crucial when performance and high availability is needed, not understanding how time and space complexity can impact our application algorithms could lead to choose components that are not a good fit for the workload and can lead to scaling and performance issues. In this talk, you are going to learn how to differentiate between some algorithms complexity and what kind of infrastructure could be a great fit.
