<p>The values from the Agile Manifesto don’t seem to say much about the craft of software engineering. In fact, they don’t say anything about engineering at all. However, digging a little bit deeper, one quickly realizes that the benefits of Agile methods and practices cannot be realized with low quality software. Agile depends on engineering excellence.</p>

<p>So forget about Agile for a moment, at least the process side of things, and pay attention to the craft of software engineering; or in other words pay attention to building software the right way. Because only then you will be able to rapidly and continuously build the right software.</p>
