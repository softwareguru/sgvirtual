Engineer with experience in AWS Cloud and automation. I'm proficient in infrastructure provisioning and monitoring, and have extensive experience implementing CI/CD pipelines, collaborating with development teams to implement observability and reliability requirements, and providing site reliability and availability. 

My expertise in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform and AWS CloudFormation has resulted in significant reductions in infrastructure deployment time and errors. I've implemented continuous delivery (CI/CD) using a variety of tools and technologies, resulting in a reduction in deployment failures and an increase in deployment frequency. 

With certifications in AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate and GitOps Certified for Argo, and skills in Kubernetes, CI/CD, Terraform, New Relic, Amazon EC2, Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Docker, Bash, PostgreSQL, AWS CloudFormation, Amazon ECS, I'm ready to bring my expertise and dedication to the next challenge in my career.
